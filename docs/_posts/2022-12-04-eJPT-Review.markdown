*TL;DR - Do the HTB Starting Point and you will be fine*

# Course
This course aims to serve as the first step in your cybersecurity career and I fully recommend it as such. I will go as far as saying that I think that more or less everyone who works in cybersecurity should give this one a try. The course and accompanying labs give a great introduction to penetration testing and how the different phases fit together. I did not go through the majority of the course content as I was using this as a warm-up for the eCPPT, but I did go through most of the labs. Both the course content I went through and the labs were great. This is one of the courses from eLearn Security that receives a lot of updates and revisions which can also be seen with the release of v2 of this certification and course.

# The exam
The exam is a simple penetration test and as is reflected in the title is for people of 'junior' level, this means that you should expect the things you are going to be doing to be simple, no need to go in and create custom scripts or modify exploits.
For preparing for the exam I have the following recommendations: 1 go through the labs though most of them are not directly relevant they will give you a good general idea of what's going on and what to expect, do the 'Starting Point' machines on HTB, and maybe play around with some easy boxes on HTB and you will be more than ready!

## Additional advice for the exam:
-	Do the ‘hidden server’ lab before, it might come in handy
-	Go through all the questions beforehand and write them down together with their possible answer. That way when you go through the exam you will know what you are looking for and can progress naturally while making sure that you get the info you need

In conclusion great course and exam no wonder this course is so popular, for sure it’s a must for anyone wanting to take their first steps into infosec or for anyone working in infosec.
